I'm a Computer Games Development Student at the University of Westinster, where we focus on the technical and creative aspects of game design and programming. My academic journey has 
equipped me with a strong foundation in key areas, such as:


* Programming
* Game Design
* 3D Modelling Fundamentals
* Game Industry Standards and Business Practices

With hands on experience, I've developed proficiency with a range of tools including:
 
* Engines & IDEs: Unity3D, Visual Studio, Unreal Engine 5
* 3D Modelling: Blender
* Development Tools: GitHub, Docker, Visual Studio Code
* Programming Languages: C++, C#, HTML

My projects section showcases some of the tools that i've used, while my Blog goes over smaller projects that i've made.

I'm excited to deepend my expertise in :

* Machine learning
* Maths & Physics for Games
* Advanced Programming Patterns (with the use of leetcode and understanding how to problem solve better).
