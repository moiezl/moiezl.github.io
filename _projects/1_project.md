Some of the components that I built as part of the project:|
* Player Script - All functionality for the player, such as double jumping, walking animation when moving and being able to interact with everything in the game and OnCollision triggers.
  
* Level design implementation - Responsible for the level designs of the game, uisng adapted level structures to ensure smooth integration with platforming, ghost form interactions andworking on fixed, timed and moving platforms, ensuring their placement enhanced gameplay flow and difficulty.
* Player animation - Simple animation for the ghost going up and down when moving/idle
* Bug fixes on scripts - Many bugxies to ensure code is working as expected as well as helping colleagues within the team for bugfixes.
* Save function implementation
